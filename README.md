The cryptomagic program takes in a .txt file containing human-legible words and encrypts it using switches


1. Create a .txt file with the plain text that you want to encrypt, and save it to the CRYPTOMAGIC folder


**open up the command prompt to run the command uitility**

2. To encrypt, type in the name of the program "cryptomagic", followed by the -E switch. After the switch, type in the file name with the extension .txt and run the program

    - If no switch is entered, the program will automatically encrypt the file entered

    - If no file extension is entered (only file name), and no switch is entered, the program will assume a .txt wants to be encrypted. 


3. To decrypt, type in the name of the program "cryptomagic", followed by the -D switch. After the switch, type in the file name with the extension .crp and run the program
    - this will delete the .crp file, and change it back into a decrypted .txt file
